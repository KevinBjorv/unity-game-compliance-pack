# Legal Disclaimer, Limitations, and User Responsibilities

**Product:** GameCompliancePack (the “Tool”)
**Publisher:** Bjorvand Solutions (Unity organization: “Bjorvand Solutions Publisher”; Asset Store name: “Kevin Bjorvand”)

## 1) Not legal advice

This Tool is provided for convenience and risk-reduction only. It does not constitute legal advice, does not create any attorney-client relationship, and does not guarantee legal compliance in any jurisdiction.

## 2) No guarantee of compliance or accuracy

Licensing, attribution, and compliance outcomes depend on facts outside the Tool’s control (for example: how you distribute your game, which third-party assets you include, the exact license versions, whether assets were modified, and whether additional terms apply). The Tool may produce false positives and false negatives, may miss embedded notices, and may not detect all legal obligations, including obligations triggered by distribution method, platform terms, or downstream use.

## 3) You remain responsible for third-party rights and license compliance

You are solely responsible for identifying and complying with all applicable licenses, notices, attributions, and other third-party rights affecting your project (including open-source, Creative Commons, proprietary, and asset store terms). Where third-party rights restrict use (especially intellectual property restrictions), your legal remedies and obligations may be governed by mandatory consumer protection rules in some jurisdictions.[1]

## 4) Marketing and representations

Do not represent that your product or project is “legally compliant” or “fully licensed” solely because the Tool ran or produced output. Misleading or incomplete claims about a product’s characteristics, benefits, or risks can be prohibited under EU unfair commercial practices rules and national marketing laws. [2]

## 5) Consumer rights may be mandatory and not waivable

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, this disclaimer limits warranties and liability as described below; however, mandatory rights may still apply in consumer relationships, including EU rules for digital content and services (and national implementations such as Norway’s digital content law). [3]

## 6) Disclaimer of warranties

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Tool is provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” without warranties or conditions of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, including implied warranties of merchantability, satisfactory quality, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. [4]

## 7) Limitation of liability

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Bjorvand Solutions will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, or for loss of data, profits, revenue, business opportunities, or goodwill, arising out of or related to the Tool or its output, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

## 8) Third-party materials; no endorsement

The Tool may reference third-party license texts, identifiers (including SPDX identifiers), and third-party resources. Third-party materials remain the property of their respective owners. References to third parties do not imply endorsement. “Unity” and the Unity logos are trademarks of Unity Technologies and its affiliates; Bjorvand Solutions is not affiliated with or endorsed by Unity.

## 9) Unity Asset Store context (informational)

Unity’s Asset Store terms include “as is” and limitation-of-liability provisions applicable to end users and clarify that assets are not pre-screened for legal compliance by Unity. [4]
As an Asset Store provider, you represent and warrant you have the rights needed to distribute what you publish, including rights to third-party materials included in your assets. [5]

## 10) Get professional advice when needed

If your project includes high-risk licenses (for example, strong copyleft licenses), user-generated content, personal data processing, or you distribute at scale, consult qualified legal counsel in your relevant jurisdictions.
